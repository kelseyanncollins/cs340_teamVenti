                <h3>Rationale</h3>
                    <p>The growing prominence of the beauty industry becomes more evident with each passing year. As of 2023, the global beauty industry market is valued at over $579 billion with 
                        projected growth to reach nearly $700 billion by 2028. Top players within the industry include the skin care and hair care subdomains. The skincare market alone was valued 
                        at $104.24 billion as of 2022 on a global scale.</p> 
                    <p>Many products are developed and marketed to target specific areas of improvement including acne treatment, anti-aging, 
                        and healthy hair growth. Similarly, many users of skincare and other dermatological-based products have specific areas of their health that they aim to improve. Due to the 
                        extended turnover cycle of the epidermis, most dermatologists recommend consistent usage of a product for at least three months in order to gauge its results. For hair loss 
                        products, this timeframe may be extended to twelve months (Shadi, 2023). Users often become discouraged and discontinue a promising product before the suggested timeframe 
                        has passed. Users may also see diminished results if they are inconsistent with the suggested routine.</p>
                    <p>The proposal for this database-driven website would be a hypothetically user-based interface. For the purposes of this project, all CRUD operations will take place within 
                        one admin user account. Multiple users can add and remove products to their own regimen. Users have the option of maintaining simple log entries to improve consistency 
                        and compliancy with their regimen. Historical entries will also log events such as the initiation and discontinuation of user products. To foster online support and 
                        improve accountability, users also have the option of joining forums—termed “communities” for this project—comprised of other users with similar goals.</p>
                    <p>With this database-driven structure, we hope to address several issues in one: improve user compliancy, encourage online support and engagement between users, provide 
                        a means for longitudinal real-time data collection (if permitted by user), and possibly receive product- specific feedback from the user-base that may inform future 
                        business decision-making.</p>
